 An image-focused bookmark manager. Still in the experimental stage, with lots of code, features, and frontends subject to change! While similar ideas have been done before, I wanted mine to focus more on setting custom display images which can be saved locally, to prevent deleted files or modified links from ruining your workflows.

 The frontend is done in JS with react, while the backend is using Go to communicate with an SQL database. The plan is to dockerize the entire project, making it easy to deploy anywhere.

 Currently, I would not reccomend deploying this project, as I am still actively working on it and it is unstable.
